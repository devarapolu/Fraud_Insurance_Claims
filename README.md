# Insurance Claims Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and predictive modeling of insurance claims to identify patterns, assess risks, and detect fraudulent activities. Utilizing a dataset with detailed insurance claim records, the project applies machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to achieve accurate fraud detection.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementation of data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature encoding to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Development and comparison of various models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), RandomForest, and a Voting Classifier for optimal fraud detection.
- **Model Interpretation**: Usage of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret model predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## Dataset Description
The `insurance_claims` dataset contains numerous features related to insurance policyholders and claim details, including but not limited to:
- Customer demographics
- Policy details (e.g., policy number, bind date)
- Claim information (e.g., incident type, claim amount)
- Temporal data (e.g., policy bind date, incident date)

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing
- **SHAP & LIME**: Model interpretation tools
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
